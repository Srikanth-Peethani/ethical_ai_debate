# Two-Agent Debate System with Rehearsal Trees and Cognitive Extension

## Overview
This project implements a structured two-agent debate system using rehearsal trees and theory-of-mind modeling. The goal is to simulate strategic argumentation between two AI agents and evaluate how cognitive modeling improves persuasive reasoning.

## Methodology
### Rehearsal Trees
Agents build trees of potential responses before answering. Each node is scored based on logical consistency, evidence, and persuasiveness.

### Theory of Mind Enhancement
The enhanced agent models emotional states and argument styles of its opponent, adapting tone and strategy accordingly.

## Theoretical Foundation

- [Rehearsal Trees Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14886 )
- [Theory of Mind](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027718303423 )
- [Emotional Intelligence](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1997-04519-000 )

## Assumptions

- Simulated knowledge base instead of real-world sources
- Model limitations due to Phi-3 capabilities
- Fixed tree depth/breadth

## Evaluation

- Qualitative comparison of debate transcripts
- Tree visualization showing planned reasoning paths
- Scoring of responses via LLM evaluation prompts

## Future Work

- Real-time user input integration
- Reinforcement learning for adaptive strategies
- Multimodal interaction support
